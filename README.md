If you're only interested in the vegetarian or vegan options you can let the widget only show these by replacing "false" with "true" next to the to the respective variables at the begining of the script.

It is also possible to hide the salad selection, as it is often the same every day. (This only works for "Studentenwerk Hannover" or if you configure the salad_category variable correctly.)
